# Health.me

Health.me is a combination of services that help patients with mental health issues get quick help, helps them get greater attention from doctors, and allows doctors to track the activity of their patients. It is a combination between an iOS app for patients and a website for doctors.

The iOS app allows patients to regularly check up with their daily intakes with medicine, track usage, and have easy access to plans that doctors create for them. They can instantly see their data processed on the phone itself and send reports to the doctor.
